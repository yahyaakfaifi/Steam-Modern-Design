This is a redesign for the Steam platform using Next.js
integrated with RAWG API for games database

It takes the data from the API (images, names, rates, etc.)

if you want to use it, you have to create an account at https://rawg.io/apidocs to use your API key (I included my API key in this project, but when the record end will see some bugs in front-end so make sure to create your own when you want to test)
because it's a free plan, and you limited to 20,000 requests per month

I hope you like it, and looking forward to your feedback.

For sure, in the future will add new features and pages to be completely real project that can use it not for the concept, also will make it responsive, but now it just works on table and desktop view.

So stay tuned, and don't forget to take a look at my blog from this link https://pundit.dev/

Peace ✌️

==================================================================================


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
